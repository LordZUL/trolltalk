John Dory,"All right, guys. We’re gonna open with “Girl, Baby, Baby” and close with “Baby, Baby, Girl.”",
John Dory,"I got it. Open with “Baby, Baby, Girl,” close with “Baby, Baby, Girl, Woman.”",
John Dory,We are gonna make boy band history tonight.,
John Dory,"I wanna see a hundred more of those by showtime, Spruce.",
John Dory,"Those abs need to be poppin’, baby. God, I wanna boil an egg on those abs.",
John Dory,"Yes, you do, Clay. They’re funderdrawers. It’s underwear, but 76% more fun.",
John Dory,"Let’s see those dance moves, Brother.",
John Dory,"Well, of course I’m stressed, Floyd. It’s the first show of the tour.",
John Dory,We have to hit the perfect family harmony. We promised the fans.,
John Dory,"If we can’t hit the perfect family harmony, we aren’t perfect. And if we aren’t perfect, we’re nothing.",
John Dory,"Just follow my lead, and the harmony will happen.",
John Dory,"I’m gonna go hike the Neverglade Trail by myself. Brolone. Yeah, that’s right.  Brobro going solo.",
John Dory,Look at you. You got so big. You’re not a branch anymore. You’re more like a trunk. Junk in the trunk,
John Dory,"I did come back, but no one was there. It wasn’t until I heard about you saving the world from the rock apocalypse that I realized you were even still alive.",
John Dory,"Okay, a lot of assumptions for someone you just met 30 seconds ago",
John Dory,"Look, Spruce, gotta cut to the chase. We’re not here to catch up. We’re here because we need to hit the perfect family harmony.",
John Dory,What? They’re memorabilia. But I will be good goshdarned if I know how they’re gonna help us find Clay.,
John Dory,"Let’s do it again from the top. Spruce, I want some smolder in those eyes. Clay, you’re being too stiff. We need some sillier robot. Bitty B, maybe a smaller diaper.",
John Dory,Why do you think I moved to the middle of nowhere? So I didn’t have to be in charge of anyone. Four little brothers is a lot of responsibility.,
Branch,"Barf, pass out and pee your pants?",
Branch,But no one’s ever hit the perfect family harmony before. Is it true it can shatter diamonds?,
Branch,But that’s all in the past. Because they stopped being my brothers the day they walked out on me and never came back.,
Branch," had breakfast. It was avocado toast with two poached eggs, some cayenne for a little kick. And you know what? It was delightful.",
Branch,So we can attempt to sing something we’ve only tried once and failed so miserably at that we broke up and never talked to each other again.,
Branch,"Okay, listen. If there was a brother that I might do this for, and I’m not saying there is, it would be Floyd.",
Branch,We gotta find our brothers and fast. But don’t worry. Old Branch’s got it handled. All we have to do is follow the clues.,
Branch,"I mean, hey, look at this. We’re never gonna find Spruce with this. I bet this sunset doesn’t even exist.",
Branch,"I have no idea why you saved these. It’s incredibly disgusting, but I’m glad you did.",
Branch,"I’m actually hatelistening. It’s a new thing. My grandma had very questionable taste. I mean, just look at how she decorated this place.",
Branch,"I was a baby. What did you want me to write about, diaper rash?",
Branch,"Listen, we don’t want any clownrelated trouble, okay? We’re just here looking for our brother Clay.",
Branch,"Oh, I’m sorry. The clue board? You mean my clue board? That I made? We like the clue board now?",
Branch,"I built a bunker, and I lived in it for years because I knew it was safe. And, sure, it kept me alive. And I never had to wear pants. But I was living without pants.",
Branch,"I stopped being a baby the day you guys walked out on me, ’cause I had to. Then Grandma got eaten, and there was no one else to take care of me. This time, I’m walking out on you.",
Branch,We don’t have to be perfect to be in harmony. We just have to be as we are. Together.,
Branch,But you lift me higher. You know I’m not wrong.  You know I’m not lying. We do it better ,
Branch,"I built the hideout, Floyd. Except the tenstory waterslide.",
Branch,Happy. Grateful. And… really sorry that it’s taken me this long to open up to you.,
Poppy,Are you all right? You’re smiling and crying at the same time. It kinda looks like it’s hurting your face.,
Poppy,"Wow. The weirdest. Ha. It’s, like, weird that we’re still talking about how weird it was. It’s, like, 15 seconds later.",
Poppy,"I love you like a sister. Probably. I don’t have a sister, so I wouldn’t know. Which is fine. It’s something I’m coming to terms with. Slowly.",
Poppy,Hey. Stop right there. You put my boyfriend down. Tell us who you are and what you want.,
Poppy,"So, if if you’re Branch’s bro, then that means that all the other BroZone bros are Branch’s bros too.",
Poppy,"We’d be best friends and we’d teach each other things. We’d never fight, we’d have each other’s backs. We wouldn’t talk ’cause we’d think the same thoughts. Everyone would ask us if we’re twins, and we’d be like, “Well, not technically”",
Poppy,"BroZone 2.0. BroZone reunion. BroZone, here we bro again. BroZone, where’d they bro? I don’t know. We’re gonna find them.",
Poppy,"Wow. Check out your old outfits. Puffy jackets. Puka shell necklaces. Denim tuxedos? Branch, did you have frosted tips?",
Poppy,Join the band? Of course I will. I thought you would never ask.,
Poppy,"So, you came here to get the band back together and sing the perfect family harmony.",
Poppy,"if she were ever in trouble, I would do everything I could to help her. I would show up.",
Poppy,"Who wrote, “Girl, I Love Your Love, Girl, You Break My Heart, Girl, I Still Love You, But I Seriously Think We Should Have A Talk About Our Relationship, Girl”?",
Poppy,"A brother is a friend who can never leave you. It’s the strongest bond in the world. I would kill to have a sibling to sing with, Branch.",
Poppy," Hi, Spruce. I’m Poppy. Wow. It’s, like It’s so cool to meet you or whatever. This is Tiny Diamond.",
Poppy, Right. Kidding. Ha! Can you imagine? I wouldn’t ask you to do that after meeting you two seconds ago. Who would do that?,
Poppy,"What do you mean, we’re sisters? How could I have not known about you? I can’t believe Dad didn’t tell me I have a sister.",
Poppy,"My best friend had her wedding, and it went off without a hitch. I was the best maid of honor. You’d be the best maid of honor. You and Bridget are gonna love each other!",
Poppy,"Wait, is this about the Bergens? Because they stopped trying to eat us. That’s all in the past.",
Poppy,I have been by your side from the moment we met. And you’ve been by mine. Let’s give each other some credit here.,
Floyd,"Bro, you look stressed. Breathe. You’re making Baby Branch nervous.",
Floyd,"Cut him some slack, John Dory. It’s his first show.",
Floyd," Pee your pants all at once? Ah, you got the preshow jitters.",
Floyd," I remember that I’m with my brothers, and that when we come together, there is nothing that we can’t do.",
Floyd,"We’re not in sync.  We’ve gone from boys to men, and now there’s only one direction for us to go: the backstreets.",
Floyd,"But right now, I have to follow my heart. It’s telling me that it’s time to start a solo career.",
Floyd,"Dear John Dory, I’m being held against my will by superstars Velvet and Veneer. Come to Mount Rageous at once and bring our brothers. Love, Floyd",
Floyd,The bottle is made of diamond. And there’s only one thing that’s powerful enough to shatter diamond,
Floyd," No. This is a trap. Velvet and Veneer, they they lured you here. You gotta leave before they come back. Hurry!",
Floyd,"I can’t believe that we almost missed out on all this. We may not be the new kids on the block anymore, but I’m loving this new edition of us",
Floyd,Wow. You’ve really grown into that vest. You’re a man now.,
Floyd,"Sibling or not, you deserve to be treated with kindness and to be around people who would never try to change the you that you are.",
Floyd,I know. Velvet would kill you. But just because she’s your sister doesn’t mean you should let her treat you like garbage,
Floyd,"Yeah, sure, dying sucks, but at least it’s for some sweet “blingading” and some bohochic home furnishings.",
Floyd,This is for all the lonely people. Thinking that life has passed us by. We won’t give up until we drink from the silver cup. And ride that highway in the sky.,
Floyd,"No, John. It’s the perfect family harmony.",
Floyd,"Velvet and Veneer are giant, popobsessed succubi with no talent, and they’ve been stealing mine. And they’ll be back any minute for more.",
Floyd,John Dory? I can’t believe it. I never thought I’d see any of my brothers again.,
Floyd,"Well, we better keep this in a safe place. I’ll see you soon, Baby Branch.",
Viva,"Course you’re in the right place. Any troll is welcome here with us. Okay, PuttPutt trolls. Lights on for our new friends!",
Viva,Fries? Fries! You guys want fries. I am seeing fries! Bring out the works!,
Viva,"Yeah, we try not to use that word around here. It’s just that “burger” sounds a little too much like, uh… Bergens.",
Viva,We got accidentally separated. And I’ve lived here ever since. The end. Wanna do candy toe rings next?,
Viva,"Oh, my gosh. Hello! My name is Viva! It is so “fantastamazing” to see other trolls.",
Viva,"Okay, this is so totally random, but I used to have one just like it. Can I see that?",
Viva,"Poppy? Okay, um, another totally random, weird question but is your dad King Peppy?",
Viva,"I’ve thought so many times about leaving, you know, to look for you and Dad, but it’s not safe out there.",
Viva,"You’re not leaving here no matter what, because, because it’s just not safe out there. You’re welcome.",
Viva,You don’t understand. I just got my sister back. I’m not gonna lose you. For anything.,
Viva,"Yeah, no. That’s not what I’m talking about. So, you’re really not gonna eat us?",
Viva,"Yeah, I’m the fun side of the operation, and Mr. Clay takes care of the boring stuff!",
Viva,"Kaleidoscopic. I’m seeing different when I look at you everything’s looking bright. No, I can’t stop it now",
Viva,"Now that you’re with me I can finally see. Colors that were up in my mind didn’t know I was blind, now that I’m with you sparks are flying loose",
Viva,"You’ve got me feeling right. Feeling right. Feeling like good vibes are at my door. Every day. Every night, ooh! It takes two. I didn’t know until I found you",
Viva,"I used to live at the Troll Tree. I was there when you were born. And you were so cute. Kinda like you are now, only teensier and weensier",
Viva,Do you wanna make candy necklaces that we never finish because we eat all the candy?,
Viva,"Whoa! I am not going to Mount Rageous. And neither are you, silly. You’re never gonna leave again.",
Viva,"No. No, Poppy, wait! Poppy, please! I want you to stay!",

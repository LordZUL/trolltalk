**Product Goal**
“Brozone is developing a Trolls typeracer where players compete with other players on the typing speed and accuracy of the movie scripts of Trolls Band Together. By the end of March, our type racer will support troll character picking, type racer with the Trolls Band Together movie script, monitoring functionalities, like speed, accuracy and typing efficiency, user account, and main lobby chat function to create a fun game advertising and uniting the Trolls fandom together and improve universal typing efficiency. Troll Talk will become a leading touch-typing practice website for trolls and typing enthusiasts looking to enhance their typing skills effectively.”

**Definition of Done**
To us, the definition of done is having most if not all sprint goals completed by a certain deadline. In our case, we hope to have a basic idea on the colour scheme, layout, and design of how the final website should look. We want our product to look close to how it’ll look when it completes, with some working features and simple designs for us to get a feel of how it’ll look when it’s complete.
